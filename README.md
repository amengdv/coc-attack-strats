# COC Strats
A tool to help you look up up-to-date Clash Of Clans Attack Strategy based on the
[Clash Of Clans Wiki](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clash_of_Clans_Wiki:Attack_Strategies)

It is going to **filter** data based on your input. so that you can look up attack strategy quickly
and experiment with new strategy when the wiki updates its data
